			<h2>The murders of John Wayne Gacy</h2>
			<p>Gacy murdered at least 33 young men and boys, and buried 26 of them in the crawl space of his house and the other 6 he threw in a nearby river. His victims included people he knew and random individuals lured from Chicago's Greyhound Bus station, Bughouse Square, or simply off the streets with the promise of a job with PDM, an offer of drink and/or drugs, or money for sex. Some victims were grabbed by force; others conned into believing Gacy (who often carried a sheriff's badge and had spotlights on his black Oldsmobile) was a policeman.</p>
			<p>Inside Gacy's home, his usual <em>modus operandi</em> was to ply a youth with drink, drugs, or generally gain his trust. He would then produce a pair of handcuffs to "show a magic trick", sometimes as part of a clowning routine. He typically cuffed his own hands behind his back, then surreptitiously released himself with the key which he hid between his fingers. He then offered to show his intended victim how to release himself from the handcuffs. With his victim manacled and unable to free himself, Gacy then made a statement to the effect that "The trick is, you have to have the key." Gacy referred to this act of restraining his victim as the "handcuff trick".</p>
			<p>Gacy's last victim was young Robert Piest who had told his mom he was going to meet some contractor who wanted to offer him a job which was later was revealed to be Gacy and an ivestigation was launched into Gacy and eventually Gacy turned himself in and confessed to everything and even showed the police where he hid all of the bodies</p>

			<h3>Origin</h3>
			<p>John Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 – December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robison (May 4, 1908 – December 6, 1989).[2][3] His father was an auto repair machinist and World War I veteran, and his mother was a homemaker.[4][5] Gacy was of Polish and Danish ancestry, and his family was Catholic.[6] His paternal grandparents (who spelled the family name as "Gatza" or "Gaca") had immigrated to the United States from Poland (then part of the German state of Prussia).</p>
			<p>Gacy was close to his mother and two sisters, but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an alcoholic who was physically abusive to his family. His father also belittled him, calling him "dumb and stupid" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters. One of Gacy's earliest memories was of his father beating him with a leather belt for accidentally disarranging components of a car engine he had assembled. His mother tried to shield her son from his father's abuse, which only resulted in accusations that he was a "sissy" and a "mama's boy" who would "probably grow up queer". Despite this mistreatment, however, Gacy still loved his father, but felt he was "never good enough" in his father's eyes.</p>
