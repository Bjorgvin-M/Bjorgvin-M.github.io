			<h2>The murders of Jeffrey Dahmer</h2>
			<p>Dahmer committed his first murder in 1978, three weeks after his graduation. At the time he was living alone in the family home in Bath. On June 18, Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named Steven Mark Hicks, who was almost 19. Dahmer lured the youth to his house on the pretext of drinking. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock concert at Chippewa Lake Park, Ohio, agreed to accompany Dahmer to his house upon the promise of "a few beers" with Dahmer as he had the house to himself but after hours of talking and quite a few beers when the young Steven Hicks wanted to leave Dahmer killed him with a 10 pound(4.5kg) dumbelland then proceeded to masturbste over the corpse.</p>
			<p>Young Steven Mark Hicks was the first of 17 men and boys which Jeffrey Dahmer killed and mistreated over a 13 year period.</p>
			<p>Dahmers last victim was 32 year old Tracy Edwards which Dahmer lured to his apartment and attempted and held him there for 5 hours before Edwards escaped and found 2 police officers which he then led to Dahmers apartment where they found polaroid pictures of the dismembered corpses of Dahmers victims and as they tried to arrest him he fought back and resisted arrest but the 2 officers were able to handle him.</p>

			<h3>Origin</h3>
			<p>Dahmer was born May 21, 1960, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the first of two sons of Joyce Annette (née Flint), a teletype machine instructor, and Lionel Herbert Dahmer, a Marquette University chemistry student and, later, research chemist.</p>
			<p>From an early age, Dahmer manifested an interest in dead animals. His fascination with dead animals may have begun when, at the age of four, he saw his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home. According to Lionel, Dahmer was "oddly thrilled" by the sound the bones made, and became preoccupied with animal bones, which he initially called his "fiddlesticks". He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones, and explored the bodies of live animals to discover where their bones were located.</p>
